# DISTINCT in SQL

This tutorial explains how to:
- Remove duplicate values using `DISTINCT`
- Retrieve the **top N results** using common SQL patterns

All examples use the **Hotel Reservations** dataset and are written for **MySQL**.

---

## What this tutorial covers

- What duplicate rows are
- How `DISTINCT` works
- Common use cases for `DISTINCT`
- Top-N query patterns using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`
- When to combine `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`

---

## Dataset used

Table: `hotel_reservations`

Example columns:
- `room_type_reserved`
- `type_of_meal_plan`

---

## Understanding duplicate values

In real-world datasets, many columns contain **repeated values**.

For example, the `type_of_meal_plan` column contains:

If you run a normal `SELECT`, duplicates are returned.

```sql
SELECT room_type_reserved
FROM hotel_reservations;
```
---

## Removing duplicates with DISTINCT

The `DISTINCT keyword removes duplicate values from the result set.

SELECT DISTINCT type_of_meal_plan
FROM hotel_reservations;

---

## DISTINCT with multiple columns

`DISTINCT` applies to the entire row, not to individual columns.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT room_type_reserved, type_of_meal_plan
FROM hotel_reservations;
```

**Expected output**

Unique combinations of room type and meal plan

The same room type may appear multiple times if paired with different meal plans

## Common use cases for DISTINCT

Use `DISTINCT` when you need to:

- See all unique categories in a column

- Understand available values before filtering

- Validate categorical data

- Build dropdowns or filters for analysis
