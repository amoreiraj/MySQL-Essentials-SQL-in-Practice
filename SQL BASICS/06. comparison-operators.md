# Comparison Operators

The most basic way to filter data in SQL is by using **comparison operators**.

In this section, you will learn how to use:

- Comparison operators on numerical data  
- Comparison operators on non-numerical data

## Dataset Used

Table: `hotel_reservations`

Example columns used in this tutorial:

- `type_of_meal_plan`
- `arrival_month`
- `booking_status`

## Comparison Operators on Numerical Data

The easiest way to understand comparison operators is to start by looking at a list of them.

| Description                     | Operator      | Example Query                                                                 | Explanation                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Equal to                        | `=`           | `SELECT * FROM hotel_reservations WHERE type_of_meal_plan = 'Not Selected';`   | Returns bookings where no meal plan was selected                            |
| Not equal to                    | `<>` or `!=`  | `SELECT * FROM hotel_reservations WHERE type_of_meal_plan <> 'Not Selected';`  | Returns bookings where a meal plan was selected                              |
| Greater than                    | `>`           | `SELECT * FROM hotel_reservations WHERE arrival_month > 10;`                   | Returns customers arriving after October                                    |
| Less than                       | `<`           | `SELECT * FROM hotel_reservations WHERE arrival_month < 8;`                    | Returns customers arriving before August                                    |
| Greater than or equal to        | `>=`          | `SELECT * FROM hotel_reservations WHERE arrival_month >= 8;`                   | Returns customers arriving in or after August                                |
| Less than or equal to           | `<=`          | `SELECT * FROM hotel_reservations WHERE arrival_month <= 5;`                   | Returns customers arriving in or before May                                  |

## Comparison Operators on Non-Numerical Data

All of the comparison operators shown above also work with **non-numerical (text) data**.

The `=` and `!=` operators are commonly used to select rows that **match** or **do not match** a specific value.

Example: return all customers who did **not** cancel their reservation.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations
WHERE booking_status != 'Canceled';
