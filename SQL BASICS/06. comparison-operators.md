# Comparison Operators and Arithmetic in SQL

The most basic way to filter data in SQL is by using **comparison operators**.

In this section, you will learn how to use:

- Comparison operators on numerical data
- Comparison operators on non-numerical data
- Arithmetic in SQL

## Dataset Used

Table: `hotel_reservations`

Example columns used in this tutorial:

- `type_of_meal_plan`
- `arrival_month`
- `booking_status`

## Comparison Operators on Numerical Data

The easiest way to understand comparison operators is to start by looking at a list of them.

| Description                     | Operator      | Example Query                                                                 | Explanation                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Equal to                        | `=`           | `SELECT * FROM hotel_reservations WHERE type_of_meal_plan = 'Not Selected';`   | Returns bookings where no meal plan was selected                            |
| Not equal to                    | `<>` or `!=`  | `SELECT * FROM hotel_reservations WHERE type_of_meal_plan <> 'Not Selected';`  | Returns bookings where a meal plan was selected                              |
| Greater than                    | `>`           | `SELECT * FROM hotel_reservations WHERE arrival_month > 10;`                   | Returns customers arriving after October                                    |
| Less than                       | `<`           | `SELECT * FROM hotel_reservations WHERE arrival_month < 8;`                    | Returns customers arriving before August                                    |
| Greater than or equal to        | `>=`          | `SELECT * FROM hotel_reservations WHERE arrival_month >= 8;`                   | Returns customers arriving in or after August                                |
| Less than or equal to           | `<=`          | `SELECT * FROM hotel_reservations WHERE arrival_month <= 5;`                   | Returns customers arriving in or before May                                  |

## Comparison Operators on Non-Numerical Data

All of the comparison operators shown above also work with **non-numerical (text) data**.

The `=` and `!=` operators are commonly used to select rows that **match** or **do not match** a specific value.

Example: return all customers who did **not** cancel their reservation.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations
WHERE booking_status != 'Canceled';
 ```
  
 ## Arithmetic in SQL

SQL supports basic arithmetic operators:

- **Addition (+)**

- **Subtraction (-)**

- **Multiplication (*)**

- **Division (/)**

Arithmetic operations in SQL are performed row by row, meaning calculations can only be done using values from the same row.
To perform calculations across multiple rows, aggregate functions are required (covered in Intermediate SQL).

Example: 

### Arithmetic Using Column Values

```sql
SELECT arrival_month,
       adr,
       adr * 0.10 AS tax_amount
FROM hotel_reservations;
  
 ```
This query calculates a 10% tax value based on the average daily rate (adr) for each reservation.
 
### Chaining Arithmetic Operations

```sql
SELECT arrival_month,
       adr,
       adr + (adr * 0.10) AS total_with_tax
FROM hotel_reservations;
```

This example shows how multiple arithmetic operations can be combined in a single expression.

## Key Takeaways

- Comparison operators are used to filter data using **WHERE**

- Numerical and text comparisons follow the same operator rules

- SQL arithmetic is performed per row

- Calculations across rows require aggregate functions
