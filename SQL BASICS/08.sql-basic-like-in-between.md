# LIKE, IN, BETWEEN

### `LIKE`: 
****Purpose****: Finds values that match a specific pattern in a text column.
****How it Works****: Uses wildcards: % (zero or more characters) and _ (a single character).
****Example****: 

- WHERE  LIKE 'A%' (finds products starting with 'A') or 
- WHERE Email LIKE '%@**Example**.com' (finds emails from **Example**.com).


```sql 
SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations
WHERE type_of_meal_plan LIKE '%Meal%';

```
```sql
SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations
WHERE room_type_reserved LIKE 'Room_%';
```

### `IN`:
**Purpose**: Checks if a value matches any value in a list.
**How it Works**: Lists multiple possible values in parentheses, separated by commas.
**Example**: 

```sql 
--filters specific room types 
SELECT Booking_ID, room_type_reserved, avg_price_per_room
FROM hotel_reservations
WHERE room_type_reserved IN ('Room_Type 1', 'Room_Type 4', 'Room_Type 6');
```




## `BETWEEN`:
**Purpose**: Selects values within a given range (inclusive of the start and end values).
**How it Works**: Specifies a lower bound and an upper bound.
**Example**: 

```sql 
-- BETWEEN: lead time range
SELECT Booking_ID, lead_time, arrival_year, arrival_month, arrival_date
FROM hotel_reservations
WHERE lead_time BETWEEN 0 AND 30;
```


```sql
-- BETWEEN: arrivals in a month window (example: Jun–Aug)
SELECT Booking_ID, arrival_year, arrival_month, arrival_date
FROM hotel_reservations
WHERE arrival_month BETWEEN 6 AND 8;
```
