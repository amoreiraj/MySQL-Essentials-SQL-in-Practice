# Data Quality Check: NULL vs Empty Strings in SQL

In SQL, `IS NULL` and `TRIM()` are commonly used together to perform **data quality checks**, especially to distinguish between **missing values** and **values that appear empty but are not truly NULL**.

This distinction is critical in real-world datasets.

## TRIM() Function in SQL

The `TRIM()` function removes unwanted whitespace from text values.

By default, it removes:
- Leading spaces (before the text)
- Trailing spaces (after the text)

This is particularly important when working with:
- User input
- Imported files (CSV, Excel, APIs)
- Legacy databases

Fields may look empty but actually contain spaces.

## NULL Values in SQL

A `NULL` value represents the **absence of a value**.  
It is different from an empty string (`''`) or a string containing spaces (`'   '`).

To check for missing values, use `IS NULL`.

## Example Query

```sql
SELECT *
FROM tutorial_billboard_top_100_year_end
WHERE song_name IS NULL
   OR TRIM(song_name) = '';
