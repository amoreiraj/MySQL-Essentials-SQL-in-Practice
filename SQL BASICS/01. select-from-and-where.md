# SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses in SQL

This tutorial introduces the core building blocks of SQL queries using the **Hotel Reservations** dataset.  
Every query you write throughout this course will be based on these clauses.

## What this tutorial covers

- The `SELECT` statement
- The `FROM` clause
- The `WHERE` clause
- How to filter data from a real-world dataset

## Dataset used

Table: `hotel_reservations`

Example columns used in this tutorial:
- `booking_id`
- `hotel`
- `no_of_adults`
- `room_type_reserved`
- `booking_status`
- `adr` (Average Daily Rate)
- `country`

## SELECT and FROM basics

Every SQL query must include **`SELECT`** and **`FROM`**, in that order.

- `SELECT` defines **which columns** you want to retrieve
- `FROM` defines **which table** those columns come from

To return **all columns** from the table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations;


So what's happening in the above query? In this case, the query is telling the database to return all the columns from the table hotel_reservations. When you run this query, you'll get back a set of results that shows values in each of these columns.

To return **specific columns** from the table:

```sql
SELECT booking_id, country, adr
FROM hotel_reservations;

Note that the two column names were separated by a comma in the query. Whenever you select multiple columns, they must be separated by commas, but you should not include a comma after the last column name.
