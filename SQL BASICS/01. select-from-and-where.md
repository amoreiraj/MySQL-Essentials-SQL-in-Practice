# SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses in SQL

This tutorial introduces the core building blocks of SQL queries using the **Hotel Reservations** dataset.  
Every query you write throughout this course will be based on these clauses.

## What this tutorial covers

- The `SELECT` statement  
- The `FROM` clause  
- The `WHERE` clause  
- How to filter data from a real world dataset

## Dataset used

Table: `hotel_reservations`

Example columns used in this tutorial:
- `booking_id`
- `hotel`
- `no_of_adults`
- `room_type_reserved`
- `booking_status`
- `adr` (Average Daily Rate)
- `country`

---

## SELECT and FROM basics

Every SQL query must include **`SELECT`** and **`FROM`**, in that order.

- `SELECT` defines **which columns** you want to retrieve  
- `FROM` defines **which table** those columns come from  

---

## Selecting all columns

To return **all columns** from the table, use:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations;
```

## Selecting specific columns

In most cases, you only need a subset of columns.

```sql
SELECT booking_id,
       country,
       adr
FROM hotel_reservations;
```

- What this query does:

Returns only the selected columns: `booking ID`, `country`and `average daily rate`. 

### Important note about column selection

- Multiple column names must be separated by commas

- Do not include a comma after the last column name
