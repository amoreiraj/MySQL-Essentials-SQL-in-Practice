# Sorting data with SQL ORDER BY

Once you know how to filter data using `WHERE`, the next step is learning how to **sort** your results.

The `ORDER BY` clause allows you to reorder query results based on the values in one or more columns.

---

## Dataset used

Table: `hotel_reservations`

Example columns used in this tutorial:
- `arrival_year`
- `type_of_meal_plan`
- `hotel`
- `adr`
- `booking_status`

---

## Default ordering of a table

If you run a query without `ORDER BY`, SQL does **not guarantee any specific order**.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations;
```

### Expected output

- All rows and columns from the table

- The order of rows is determined by the database engine

- You should not rely on this order for analysis

## Sorting results with ORDER BY

To sort results based on a column, use ORDER BY.

Example: sort bookings by meal plan.

SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations
ORDER BY type_of_meal_plan;

- What this query does

-- Sorts rows based on type_of_meal_plan

-- Results are ordered alphabetically from A to Z by default

### Expected output

- Rows grouped and ordered by meal plan name

- Same meal plans appear together

- Sorting in descending order

**By default, ORDER BY sorts in ascending order.**

### To reverse the order, use the DESC keyword.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations
ORDER BY type_of_meal_plan DESC;
```

### Expected output

- Rows ordered alphabetically from Z to A

- Useful when you want to see highest or latest values first

## Using WHERE with ORDER BY

You can combine filtering (WHERE) with sorting (ORDER BY).

Example: return bookings from the year 2017 and sort them by arrival year.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations
WHERE avg_price_per_room >= 65
ORDER BY arrival_year;
```

### Expected output

- Only bookings from 2017

- Results sorted in ascending order by arrival_year


## BY in descending order with WHERE

To sort filtered results in descending order, place DESC after the column name.

SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations
WHERE arrival_year = 2017
ORDER BY adr DESC;

What this query does

Filters bookings from 2017

Sorts them by average daily rate from highest to lowest

Expected output

Highest-priced bookings appear at the top

Lower-priced bookings appear last

Sorting by multiple columns

You can sort by more than one column.

SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations
ORDER BY hotel,
         adr DESC;

Expected output

Rows grouped by hotel

Within each hotel, bookings are sorted by ADR from highest to lowest

Common mistakes to avoid

Writing ORDER BY DESC column_name (incorrect syntax)

Assuming data is sorted without ORDER BY

Using ORDER BY before WHERE

Forgetting that text sorting is alphabetical
