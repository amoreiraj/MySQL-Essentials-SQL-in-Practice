# Sorting Data with SQL `ORDER BY`

Once you know how to filter data using `WHERE`, the next step is learning how to **sort** your results.

The `ORDER BY` clause allows you to reorder query results based on the values in one or more columns.

---

## Dataset Used

Table: `hotel_reservations`

Example columns used in this tutorial:

- `arrival_year`
- `type_of_meal_plan`
- `hotel`
- `adr`
- `booking_status`

---

## Default Ordering of a Table

If you run a query without `ORDER BY`, SQL does **not guarantee any specific order**.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations;
```

### Expected Output

- All rows and columns from the table  
- Row order is determined by the database engine  
- You should not rely on this order for analysis  

---

## Sorting Results with `ORDER BY`

To sort results based on a column, use `ORDER BY`.

Example: sort bookings by meal plan.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations
ORDER BY type_of_meal_plan;
```

### What This Query Does

- Sorts rows based on `type_of_meal_plan`
- Results are ordered alphabetically from **A to Z** by default

### Expected Output

- Rows grouped and ordered by meal plan name  
- Same meal plans appear together  

---

## Sorting in Descending Order

By default, `ORDER BY` sorts in ascending order.

To reverse the order, use the `DESC` keyword.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations
ORDER BY type_of_meal_plan DESC;
```

### Expected Output

- Rows ordered alphabetically from **Z to A**
- Useful when you want to see highest or latest values first

---

## Using `WHERE` with `ORDER BY`

You can combine filtering (`WHERE`) with sorting (`ORDER BY`).

Example: return bookings with an average price per room of at least 65, sorted by arrival year.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations
WHERE avg_price_per_room >= 65
ORDER BY arrival_year;
```

### Expected Output

- Only bookings that meet the filter condition  
- Results sorted in ascending order by `arrival_year`  

---

## Using `DESC` with `WHERE`

To sort filtered results in descending order, place `DESC` after the column name.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations
WHERE arrival_year = 2017
ORDER BY adr DESC;
```

### What This Query Does

- Filters bookings from the year 2017  
- Sorts them by average daily rate from highest to lowest  

### Expected Output

- Highest-priced bookings appear at the top  
- Lower-priced bookings appear last  

---

## Sorting by Multiple Columns

You can sort by more than one column.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM hotel_reservations
ORDER BY hotel,
         adr DESC;
```

### Expected Output

- Rows grouped by hotel  
- Within each hotel, bookings are sorted by ADR from highest to lowest  

---

## Key Takeaways

- SQL does not guarantee row order without `ORDER BY`
- `ORDER BY` sorts results based on one or more columns
- Ascending order is the default
- Use `DESC` to reverse sorting
- `ORDER BY` is always written **after** `WHERE`
