## Filtering rows with WHERE

The WHERE clause filters rows based on a condition.

Example: return only bookings that were not cancelled:

```sql
SELECT booking_id,
       hotel,
       adr,
       booking_status
FROM hotel_reservations
WHERE booking_status = 'Not_Canceled';
```

### Expected output

- Only bookings with booking_status = 'Not_Canceled'

- Cancelled bookings are excluded

- Columns shown: booking ID, hotel, ADR, and status

## Combining SELECT and WHERE

You can combine column selection and filtering in the same query.

```sql
SELECT booking_id,
       country,
       adr
FROM hotel_reservations
WHERE adr > 150;
```
